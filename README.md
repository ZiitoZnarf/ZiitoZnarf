## Much Halloness to you ðŸ‘‹
He/Him | 20 

I am currently a Software Engineering junior attending Arizona State Univerity.
Many of my repositories are filled with class projects or Barrett Honors Enrichment Contracts which I have completed.
I am most interested in web development, computer networking, and software security.
Let me know if you have any tips or resources that would apply to any area of software development.
